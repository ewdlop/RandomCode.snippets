To integrate **Steam achievements** into a .NET desktop application (outside Unity), you can still use **Steamworks.NET** if your application qualifies as a game or if Steam allows your application on its platform. Here’s how you might set it up:

### 1. Setting Up Steamworks.NET for a .NET Desktop App
- **Download Steamworks.NET**: You can get it from the [Steamworks.NET GitHub repository](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET).
- **Configure Steamworks for .NET Framework**: Steamworks.NET works natively with .NET Framework, but you may need additional configuration for .NET Core/5+. Check compatibility on their GitHub page.

### 2. Setting Up Steamworks for a Non-Unity C# Project
- Add `Steamworks.NET.dll` to your .NET project references.
- Include a `steam_appid.txt` file in the project directory with your Steam App ID. You can find this ID on the Steamworks Partner site.

### 3. Initializing Steamworks in a .NET Desktop App
Add Steam initialization in the main application class:

```csharp
using Steamworks;

public class Program
{
    [STAThread]
    public static void Main()
    {
        // Initialize Steam
        if (!SteamAPI.Init())
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Failed to initialize Steam API.");
            return;
        }
        
        // Your app logic here
        Console.WriteLine("Steam API initialized successfully.");
        
        // Remember to shutdown SteamAPI on app close
        Application.ApplicationExit += (sender, e) => SteamAPI.Shutdown();
        
        // Start your application
        Application.Run(new MainForm());
    }
}
```

### 4. Creating and Managing Achievements
In your Steamworks Partner Dashboard, define achievements such as "Job Interview," "Workaholic," and "Micromanagement." Each achievement will have a unique identifier (like `ACH_JOB_INTERVIEW`), which you can use to unlock achievements in code.

### 5. Unlocking Achievements Programmatically
Use the following code to unlock achievements from your .NET app:

```csharp
public static void UnlockAchievement(string achievementID)
{
    if (!SteamManager.Initialized) return;
    
    SteamUserStats.SetAchievement(achievementID);
    SteamUserStats.StoreStats();
    Console.WriteLine($"Achievement '{achievementID}' unlocked!");
}
```

### Example Achievement Code
Here’s an example of unlocking these specific Steam achievements based on certain conditions:

```csharp
public static void CheckAchievements(bool completedJobInterview, int workHours)
{
    if (completedJobInterview)
    {
        UnlockAchievement("ACH_JOB_INTERVIEW");
    }

    if (workHours > 60)
    {
        UnlockAchievement("ACH_WORKAHOLIC");
    }

    if (/* Add condition for micromanagement */)
    {
        UnlockAchievement("ACH_MICROMANAGER");
    }
}
```

### 6. Testing and Debugging Achievements
- **Run the app via the Steam client** to ensure the Steam overlay and other Steamworks features are available.
- **Reset achievements** for testing as needed using the Steam Achievement Manager or in the Steamworks dashboard.

### Additional Features in Steamworks.NET for .NET Desktop Apps
- **Statistics Tracking**: Log metrics with `SteamUserStats.SetStat`.
- **Leaderboards and Networking**: Available as with Unity, although more relevant for game-style applications.

### Important Considerations
Steam achievements are typically associated with games, so using Steam achievements for a desktop application may require special approval from Steam.
