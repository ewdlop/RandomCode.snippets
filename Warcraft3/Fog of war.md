Here are the visibility effects and techniques with the sources attached to each method:

### 1. **Polarization Filters**
- **How It Works**: Polarizing filters allow light waves vibrating in certain directions to pass through. Aligning the object's lighting polarization differently from the lens filter can control its visibility.

### 2. **Chromatic Aberration and Color Filtering**
- **How It Works**: Applying unique colors or chromatic aberration to objects can reveal them only when viewed through a specific color filter.

### 3. **Holographic or Lenticular Effects**
- **How It Works**: Lenticular printing and holography display images differently depending on the viewing angle, often using lenses or diffraction to change visibility.

### 4. **Refraction and Reflection Techniques**
- **How It Works**: Using refractive materials like glass or water can distort or obscure objects when viewed from certain perspectives, depending on the medium.

### 5. **Infrared or Ultraviolet Lighting and Filters**
- **How It Works**: IR or UV light can make objects invisible to the naked eye but visible through IR/UV-sensitive filters.

### 6. **Fresnel Lenses for Directional Viewing**
- **How It Works**: Fresnel lenses bend light in specific ways, allowing objects to be visible only from certain angles.

### 7. **Partial Transparency and Scrim Material**
- **How It Works**: Scrims become transparent or opaque based on lighting direction, commonly used to create hidden effects on stage.

### 8. **Parallax Barrier Techniques**
- **How It Works**: Parallax barriers can mask images so they are only visible from specific angles, often used in 3D displays.
