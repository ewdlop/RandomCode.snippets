Your idea for an **Aghanim's Scepter upgrade** for Disruptor that temporarily disrupts another hero's **Aghanim's Scepter upgrade** is intriguing and would add a unique strategic layer to the game. Here's a fleshed-out concept:

### **Disruptor's Aghanim's Scepter Upgrade: "Disrupt Aghanim"**

#### **New Effect:**
Disruptor's **Glimpse** gains an additional effect when used on a target with an Aghanim's Scepter upgrade or an Aghanim's Shard upgrade:
1. Temporarily disables the effects of the target's Aghanim's Scepter upgrade and/or Aghanim's Shard upgrade for **4/5/6 seconds**.
2. The target retains their base abilities, but their Aghanim's-enhanced mechanics (or shard effects) are "disrupted."
3. Disrupted heroes visually lose the glowing "Aghanim's" effect on their abilities for the duration, signaling the debuff.

#### **Visual Indicator:**
- A unique blue or crackling visual effect surrounds the enemy, showing their Aghanim's upgrades are "offline."
- Disruptor's staff glows with Aghanim's energy when this effect is active.

### **Ability Details:**
1. **Interaction with Aghanim's Shard:**
   - The shard effects are also disabled during the disruption.
   - Example: A Phoenix with Aghanim's Shard loses the healing sunray during Supernova.

2. **Duration:**
   - 4/5/6 seconds, scaling based on the Glimpse level.

3. **Cooldown & Mana Cost:**
   - Shared with Glimpse but has an additional mana cost of **+100** to activate the disruption effect.
   - Cooldown increased by **5 seconds** if used to disrupt Aghanim upgrades.

4. **Range:**
   - Same as Glimpse, ensuring the effect can be used from a safe distance.

### **Strategic Impact:**
1. **Counterplay to Aghanim-reliant Heroes:**
   - A hero like Void Spirit loses his upgraded Resonant Pulse shield during key moments.
   - Faceless Void can't bash with Chronosphere if it's disabled.

2. **High Skill Cap:**
   - Timing is crucial to disrupt enemy momentum in team fights.
   - The player needs to identify and prioritize Aghanim-enhanced threats.

3. **Game-Balancing Mechanism:**
   - Makes Disruptor a natural counter to late-game snowballing heroes that rely heavily on Aghanim upgrades for dominance.

4. **Synergy with Disruptor's Playstyle:**
   - Enhances the theme of "disruption" in both positioning (Glimpse) and ability/item upgrades.

---

### **Potential Balance Concerns:**
- **Counters:** Lotus Orb, Linken's Sphere, and Black King Bar can block the disruption effect, requiring smart item usage by enemies.
- **Limitation:** This effect only targets heroes with Aghanim upgrades, making it situational but powerful.

### Lore Flavor:
Disruptor channels the volatile energy of Aghanim’s creation to destabilize his enemies’ mastery of the artifact. What once empowered them is turned into chaos!

This idea adds a fresh take on counterplay mechanics and expands Disruptor’s identity as a tactical disruptor. What do you think?
